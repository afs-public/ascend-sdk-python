# CumulativeNotionalValueDirection

This represents the direction of the total filled notional value, which will be present if the `cumulative_notional_value` is also present. If there are no executions, this value will be absent. When the summed notional value of all CREDIT legs exceeds that of the DEBIT legs a CREDIT will be reported here; otherwise a DEBIT will be reported.
